## Overview

HuduGlue uses a **multi-tenant architecture** where all data is isolated by **Organization**. This design is specifically built for:

- **MSPs (Managed Service Providers)** - Manage multiple client organizations from a single installation
- **IT Departments** - Separate data by department, division, or subsidiary
- **Multi-Company Environments** - Maintain strict data separation between business units

### Key Concepts

- **Organization**: A tenant/workspace that contains isolated data (assets, passwords, documents, etc.)
- **Membership**: A user's association with an organization, defining their role and permissions
- **User Type**: Determines if a user is internal staff or an organization-specific user
- **Role**: Defines what actions a user can perform within an organization

---

## Multi-Tenancy Model

### Data Isolation

**Everything is scoped to an organization:**

```
Organization: "Acme Corp"
├── Assets (servers, workstations, devices)
├── Passwords (encrypted credentials)
├── Documents (knowledge base articles)
├── Diagrams (network diagrams, process flows)
├── Processes (runbooks, procedures)
├── Contacts (people at this organization)
├── Files (attachments, uploads)
├── Website Monitors (uptime checks)
├── Racks & Subnets (infrastructure)
└── Secure Notes (ephemeral messages)
```

**Users cannot see data from other organizations unless:**
- They have a Membership in that organization (assigned by owner/admin)
- They are a Staff User (see [User Types](#user-types))

### Organization Switching

Users with access to multiple organizations can switch between them:

1. Click organization name in top navigation bar
2. Select different organization from dropdown
3. All views immediately filter to show only that organization's data

**Active Organization** is stored in the session and persists across pages.

---

## User Types

HuduGlue supports two distinct user types, designed for the MSP model:

### 1. Organization Users (Client Users)

**Default user type** - Standard client/customer users.

**Characteristics:**
- Can only access organizations they are explicitly invited to
- Must have a Membership record for each organization
- Cannot see global data or other organizations
- Typical use: Client employees, department staff

**Example Scenario:**
```
User: john@acmecorp.com (Organization User)
Memberships:
  - Acme Corp (Admin role)

Can see: Only Acme Corp data
Cannot see: Other client organizations, global KB, system settings
```

### 2. Staff Users (MSP Techs)

**Internal staff** - Your MSP technicians, administrators.

**Characteristics:**
- Can access **ALL organizations** regardless of membership
- Have global visibility across entire platform
- Can create and manage organizations
- Access Global Knowledge Base (internal documentation)
- Shown with blue "Staff" badge in UI

**Example Scenario:**
```
User: tech@mspreboot.com (Staff User)
Memberships: (optional - can access all orgs without membership)

Can see: All client organizations, global KB, system settings
Automatic: Admin-level access to all organizations
```

**How to Make a User a Staff User:**
1. Navigate to Admin > User Management
2. Edit user profile
3. Change "User Type" from "Organization User" to "Staff User"
4. Save

---

## Best Practices

### For MSPs

✅ **DO:**
- Make all your technicians **Staff Users**
- Use **Organization Users** for all clients
- Create an internal organization or use Global KB for your own documentation
- Assign at least 2 Owners per client organization (redundancy)
- Use custom role templates for specialized access (e.g., "Help Desk", "Junior Tech")

❌ **DON'T:**
- Don't make clients Staff Users (they'll see all other clients!)
- Don't share accounts between technicians
- Don't assign Owner role to junior techs
- Don't give Read-Only users access to password values

---

### For IT Departments

✅ **DO:**
- Create separate organizations for each department/division
- Use Staff Users for IT team members
- Assign department heads as Owners of their respective orgs
- Use role templates for specialized roles (e.g., "Network Admin", "Security Team")

❌ **DON'T:**
- Don't put all departments in one organization (no isolation)
- Don't make all IT staff Superusers (unnecessary privilege)

---

### Security Guidelines

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Start with Read-Only, elevate as needed
   - Use Editor role for day-to-day work, not Admin

2. **Owner Role Protection**
   - Limit Owner role to 2-3 trusted users
   - Owners can delete entire organizations (dangerous)

3. **Staff User Control**
   - Only promote trusted internal employees to Staff
   - Staff can access ALL client data (high privilege)

4. **Regular Audits**
   - Review members quarterly
   - Remove inactive users promptly
   - Check role assignments for correctness

5. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Enforce 2FA for all Owners and Staff Users
   - Recommended for all users

6. **API Key Management**
   - Limit `api_keys_manage` permission
   - Rotate keys every 90 days
   - Use separate keys per integration

## Troubleshooting

### "User cannot see organization"

**Problem:** Invited user logs in but organization doesn't appear.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Membership exists:
   - Navigate to **Members** in that organization
   - Check if user is listed

2. Check if membership is active:
   - Membership may be set to `is_active=False`
   - Edit membership and enable it

3. Try switching organizations:
   - User may need to manually switch (click org name in nav)

---

### "Permission denied when creating X"

**Problem:** User gets permission error despite having correct role.

**Solutions:**
1. Check if custom role template is assigned:
   - Custom templates override simple roles
   - Edit membership and check "Role Template" field

2. Verify organization context:
   - User may be in wrong organization
   - Switch to correct org

3. For Staff Users:
   - Staff bypass membership checks
   - Ensure user profile has `user_type='staff'`

---

### "Cannot delete organization"

**Problem:** Delete button doesn't appear or fails.

**Solutions:**
1. Check permissions:
   - Only **Superusers** can delete organizations
   - Owners cannot delete (security measure)

2. Use maintenance page:
   - Navigate to **Admin > Maintenance**
   - Find "Organization Management" section
   - Follow deletion process

---

### "Staff user cannot access organization"

**Problem:** Staff user shows errors when accessing org.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Staff status:
   - Check user profile: User Type should be "Staff User"
   - Not just Django staff status

2. Check if organization is active:
   - Inactive orgs may not be accessible
   - Django admin: Organizations → Edit → `is_active=True`

---

## API Access Control

Organizations are enforced in the API using the same membership system.

### API Key Scoping

API keys are **user-scoped**, not organization-scoped:

```bash
# User has access to Acme Corp and Contoso Ltd

# Request Acme Corp assets
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey YOUR_KEY" \
  https://yourdomain.com/api/assets/?organization=acme-corp

# Request Contoso Ltd assets
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey YOUR_KEY" \
  https://yourdomain.com/api/assets/?organization=contoso-ltd
```

**If user doesn't have membership in requested organization:** `403 Forbidden`

**Staff Users:** Can access all organizations via API automatically.

---

## Advanced: Organization Managers

For custom organization querying in Django:

```python
from core.models import Organization
from accounts.models import Membership

# Get all organizations for a user
user_orgs = Organization.objects.filter(
    memberships__user=request.user,
    memberships__is_active=True
).distinct()

# Check if user has access to organization
org = Organization.objects.get(slug='acme-corp')
has_access = Membership.objects.filter(
    user=request.user,
    organization=org,
    is_active=True
).exists()

# Get user's role in organization
membership = Membership.objects.get(
    user=request.user,
    organization=org
)
permissions = membership.get_permissions()
if permissions.vault_view:
    # User can view passwords
```

---

## Summary

HuduGlue's multi-tenant architecture provides:

✅ **Complete data isolation** between organizations
✅ **Flexible access control** with 4 simple roles + 42 granular permissions
✅ **MSP-optimized** with Staff vs Organization user types
✅ **Scalable** for 1 organization or 100+ clients
✅ **Secure by default** with least-privilege access

**Key Takeaway:** Everything in HuduGlue is scoped to an organization, and users can only access what they're explicitly granted through memberships.
