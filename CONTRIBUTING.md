## 🎨 Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

Follow **PEP 8** with these specifics:

```python
# Good
def calculate_total_cost(items, tax_rate=0.0):
    """Calculate total cost including tax."""
    subtotal = sum(item.price for item in items)
    return subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)

# Bad
def calc_cost(i,t=0):
    s=sum([x.price for x in i])
    return s*(1+t)
```

### Django Best Practices

- Use Django ORM instead of raw SQL when possible
- Always use parameterized queries
- Follow Django's model conventions
- Use Django's built-in authentication and permissions
- Validate all user input
- Escape output to prevent XSS

### Security Practices

- **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
- **Validate input** - Never trust user input
- **Parameterize queries** - Prevent SQL injection
- **Escape output** - Prevent XSS
- **Check permissions** - Verify user authorization
- **Log security events** - Use audit logging
- **Encrypt sensitive data** - Use provided encryption utilities

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 manage.py test

# Run specific app tests
python3 manage.py test core

# Run specific test
python3 manage.py test core.tests.test_models.OrganizationTestCase

# Run with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
coverage html  # Generate HTML report
```

### Writing Tests

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from core.models import Organization

class OrganizationTestCase(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test data."""
        self.org = Organization.objects.create(
            name="Test Org",
            slug="test-org"
        )

    def test_organization_creation(self):
        """Test organization is created correctly."""
        self.assertEqual(self.org.name, "Test Org")
        self.assertEqual(self.org.slug, "test-org")

    def test_organization_str(self):
        """Test string representation."""
        self.assertEqual(str(self.org), "Test Org")
```

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Minimum**: 70% coverage
- **Target**: 85% coverage
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage (authentication, encryption, payments)

## 📚 Documentation

### Code Documentation

```python
def encrypt_password(plaintext: str, master_key: bytes) -> str:
    """
    Encrypt a password using AES-GCM.

    Args:
        plaintext: The plaintext password to encrypt
        master_key: The master encryption key (32 bytes)

    Returns:
        Base64-encoded string containing nonce + ciphertext

    Raises:
        ValueError: If master_key is invalid
        EncryptionError: If encryption fails

    Example:
        >>> encrypted = encrypt_password("mypassword", master_key)
        >>> decrypted = decrypt_password(encrypted, master_key)
        >>> assert decrypted == "mypassword"
    """
    # Implementation here
```

### User Documentation

- Update README.md, FEATURES.md, or SECURITY.md as appropriate
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Provide examples for new features
- Document new features in commit messages and pull requests
