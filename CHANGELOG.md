## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-10

### 🚀 One-Line Installation

**Major improvement:** Complete automated installation with zero manual steps!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agit8or1/huduglue.git && cd huduglue && bash install.sh
```

The installer now does EVERYTHING:
- Installs all system dependencies (Python, MariaDB, build tools, libraries)
- Creates virtual environment and installs Python packages
- Generates secure encryption keys automatically
- Creates and configures .env file
- Sets up database with proper schema
- Creates log directory with correct permissions
- Runs all database migrations
- Creates superuser account (interactive prompt)
- Collects static files
- **Automatically starts production server with systemd**

**When the installer finishes, the server is RUNNING!** No manual commands needed.

**Smart Detection & Upgrade System:**
The installer now detects existing installations and provides options:
- **Option 1: Upgrade/Update** - Pull latest code, update dependencies, run migrations, restart service (zero downtime)
- **Option 2: System Check** - Comprehensive health check (Python, database, service, port, HTTP response)
- **Option 3: Clean Install** - Automated cleanup and fresh reinstall
- **Option 4: Exit** - Leave installation untouched

Detects: .env file, virtual environment, systemd service, database
Shows: Current status of all components before prompting
